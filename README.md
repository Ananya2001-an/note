## Inspiration üí°
There are many productivity apps online but because of too many non-essential features, it can be sometimes ugly. I always wanted to make my own note taking app which has a minimal aesthetic and is easy to use on the first go without having to go through a big manual of information. I hope this app can help students like me to manage their school life with some ease. ‚ô•

## How to contribute? üë©‚Äçüíª
1. GitPod
2. Local development

> First of all, you need to fork the repository so that you can make changes in your own copy and not directly to the upstream repository. Later you can raise a pull request to merge your changes to the main branch of upstream repo. 

## GitPod
In the cloud-free development environment which will have all the dependencies you need. You can use Gitpod in the cloud. [![Open in GitPod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Ananya2001-an/note)

## Local development
This environment is fully on computer and requires each dependency (for example NodeJS) to be installed and set up, but gives you the most flexibility for customisation.

### Prequisites
- Nodejs
- Git

### Commands
1. Clone your forked repo on your local machine using command `git clone https://github.com/{username}/note.git`
2. Run `npm install` in terminal to install all dependencies mentioned in package.json file.
3. Also create a `.env` file in which you must add the server url. You can refer the `.env.example` file for it. To run the server you have to clone the `note-server` repo in my repositories list which serves as the backend for this project. You can read the readme of note-server repository to get started on it.
4. Finally run `npm run start` script to start the app in dev mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.You may also see any lint errors in the console.
